High Priority:
YM2612:test SSG + LFO programs on real hardware

Medium Priority:
YM2612:key-on should just set the ATTACK state, ATTACK state should do inf rate & volume calculation

Low Priority:
YM2612:not happy with special if case for invert+hold - generic not happy when attenuation > 0x200 then invert it
YM2612:key off and release state with the SSG settings especially attack
YM2612:SSG what is its special attenuation value to trigger it to next cycle
YM2612:implement MEM output from OP1 & OP2 for slots - read Steve Strange reply on forums

Future Stuff:

High Priority:
YM2612:ADSR delta calculation work out the equation that makes it

Medium Priority:
