High Priority:
YM2612:timer A & B values could be cached instead of re-computing
YM2612:compute max freq value and add it on if freq goes -ve because of detune

Medium Priority:
YM2612:rename internal _channel functions which work on slots to _slot functions and pass in debug flags
YM2612:ADSR update numbers can be computed once per output (ADSR rates+key scale rate)- not inside updateEG

Low Priority:
TEST_APP: VGM debug on/off

Future Stuff:

High Priority:
YM2612:implement MEM output from OP1 & OP2 for slots - read Steve Strange reply on forums
YM2612:implement LFO
YM2612:implement LJ_LR_AMS_PMS = 0xB4 (AMS, PMS)
YM2612:implement LJ_AM_DR = 0x60 (AM part)
YM2612:implement SSG

Medium Priority:
VGM:zlib support for compressed files
VGM:handle the other commands (skip correct amount of data basically)
VGM:read all of data into memory and read from memory instead of a few bytes at a time (not needed if switch supporting zlib)
VGM:expose header info

Low Priority:
TEST_APP:test all block & fnum values then put output into FFT to output the frequency
TEST_APP:have real time graph plotting thingy
YM2612:ADSR delta calculation work out the equation that makes it
