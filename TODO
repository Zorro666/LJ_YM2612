High Priority:
YM2612:get my own ASM->BIN running in Kega

Medium Priority:
YM2612:not happy with special if case for invert+hold - generic not happy attenuation > 0x200 then invert it
YM2612:key-on should just set the ATTACK state, ATTACK state should do inf rate & volume calculation
YM2612:implement LFO, LJ_LR_AMS_PMS = 0xB4 (AMS, PMS), LJ_AM_DR = 0x60 (AM part)
YM2612:key off and release state with the SSG settings especially attack
YM2612:SSG what is its min attentuation to trigger it to next cycle

Low Priority:
YM2612:implement MEM output from OP1 & OP2 for slots - read Steve Strange reply on forums

Future Stuff:

High Priority:
VGM:read all of data into memory and read from memory instead of disk
VGM:handle the other commands (skip correct amount of data basically)

Medium Priority:
YM2612:ADSR delta calculation work out the equation that makes it

Low Priority:
TEST_APP:test all block & fnum values then put output into FFT to output the frequency
TEST_APP:have real time graph plotting thing
