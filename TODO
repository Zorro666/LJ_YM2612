TEST: LJ_GYM_reset
Add generation function to make output
save output as RAW file
save output as WAV file

Not sure about this way:
* Register set per port
* 3 channels per port
* 4 operators per channel

Perhaps just:
* 6 channels
* global state for LFO, SSG, DAC, Timers

error handling for unknown/unsupported register (be nice to make it say UNKNOWN REGISTER)

Implement support for these registers:
LJ_KEY_ONOFF = 0x28,
LJ_DAC = 0x2A,
LJ_DAC_EN = 0x2B,
LJ_FREQLSB = 0xA0,
LJ_BLOCK_FREQMSB = 0xA4,
LJ_FEEDBACK_ALGO = 0xB0,
LJ_LR_AMS_PMS = 0xB4,

implement a tick function
implement an output function
implement support for the DAC output

output wave so it can be plotted
have real time graph plotting thingy

get basic tone generation working e.g. EG value
get basic amplitude working e.g. AG value

implement operators
implement the DAC
implement ADSR
implement LFO
implement SSG
implement timers
implement ch 3 and 6 special frequency mode
