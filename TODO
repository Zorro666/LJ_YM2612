High Priority:
VGM:read all of data into memory and read from memory instead of a few bytes at a time (like when use zlib)

Medium Priority:
VGM:zlib support for compressed files

Low Priority:
YM2612:implement SSG
YM2612:implement LFO
YM2612:implement LJ_LR_AMS_PMS = 0xB4 (AMS, PMS)
YM2612:implement LJ_AM_DR = 0x60 (AM part)

Future Stuff:

High Priority:
VGM:handle the other commands (skip correct amount of data basically)
YM2612:implement MEM output from OP1 & OP2 for slots - read Steve Strange reply on forums

Medium Priority:
YM2612:ADSR delta calculation work out the equation that makes it

Low Priority:
TEST_APP:test all block & fnum values then put output into FFT to output the frequency
TEST_APP:have real time graph plotting thingy
